# debug
# - Enables Step Debugging. This can be used to step through your code while it is running, and analyse values of variables.

# gcstats
# - Enables Garbage Collection Statistics to collect statistics about PHP's Garbage Collection Mechanism.

# profile
# - Enables Profiling, with which you can analyse performance bottlenecks with tools like KCacheGrind.

# trace
